                            Google auth is one of the most commonly used Authentication methods in Mobile and web apps.
                            Well, it is also a tricky one as compared to normal user email and password auth.

                    I had the pleasure of working with Suyash for over a years at Playnoot, collaborating on several
                    project requirements and problems. As a mobile developer, Suyash has been an invaluable asset to our
                    team. Their expertise in mobile development, particularly with React Native, is impressive and has
                    resulted in highly efficient and user-friendly mobile applications.
                    <br /><br />
                    Suyash is not only technically skilled but also has a creative approach to problem-solving that has
                    led to innovative solutions for our projects. They consistently meet deadlines and are always
                    willing to go the extra mile to ensure the quality of their work.
                    <br /><br />
                    Beyond their technical skills, Suyash is a joy to work with. They are a team player who brings a
                    positive attitude to the workplace and is always ready to help others.
                    <br /><br />
                    I wholeheartedly recommend Suyash for any mobile development position. Their blend of technical
                    skills, work ethic, and teamwork makes them an asset to any team.

                <p class="description">
                    I hired Suyash to build a React Native App that we a currently working on together. I started
                    building the app but with full-time work I found it hard to develop on my own. I spent such a long
                    time looking via freelancer pages and contacting developers directly but I wasn't happy with any of
                    the options. I found Suyash via a recommendation and my search was over.
                    <br /><br />
                    This developer is exceptionally talented. After reviewing the work he's been doing for me I was
                    impressed to read code so easily. His architecture is logical and robust as well. I was able to
                    follow the code straight away as soon as he shared it with me. This developer writes clean code.
                    He's also very responsive, as soon as I message him, within 30 mins he's responded. He will even
                    take the time to respond during non working hours. I hesitate to contact him at times because I know
                    he'll stop what he's doing to answer me. I have worked with a lot or IT engineers throughout my 18
                    year career and I have to say he's one of the best.
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm quite pedantic about my product and will make suggestions on the app from a client and developer
                    perspective. Suyash will listen and make changes as you wish with no hesitation, he's ability to
                    also respond with even better suggestions makes you want to learn from him. His ability to find a
                    solution so quick for a specific problem that is unique to the project is uncanny.
                    <br /><br />
                    I have a few projects that I want to bring to life and Suyash is the developer I will always use. If
                    you're looking for a React Native or MERN developer you've come to the right page.
